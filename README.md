# Hacker Clues

## Requirements
- [ ] I need ui consuming http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query= and value of the query to come from a textbox
- [ ] make a react project consuming this api , using typescript
- [ ] with paginationÂ 
- [ ] use TailwindCSS ( it would be helpful if you learn this as we are using it in the project )
- you need to commit everything to github
- i need an invite
    - um... it's public so I suppose it's no longer necessary? ðŸ˜•
- [ ] make everything live on github
    - ghpages should do nicely
    - S mentioned render.com, but I can't use a free account

### 23 Mar
- Project setup done
- I'm assuming serious testing is out of scope
- I'm not going to bother with jsdoc for now
- Using [https://ajv.js.org](ajv) to validate json schema, it can work with ts types
- Wrote partial types for search api results
